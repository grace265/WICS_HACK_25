                    <h2>What is a No-Kill Shelter?</h2>
                    <p>A "no-kill" shelter is an animal rescue that saves every healthy, adoptable pet and only euthanizes animals for severe medical or behavioral reasons. These shelters focus on finding homes for pets, providing necessary medical care, and offering adoption services. They often rely on foster care and community partnerships to avoid overcrowding. While the term "no-kill" can vary, the goal is to eliminate unnecessary euthanasia, giving every animal a chance at a better life. No-kill shelters work to reduce pet overpopulation and promote responsible pet ownership through education and outreach.</p>

                    <h2>However...</h2>
                    <p>Pit bulls are often unfairly singled out for euthanasia due to misconceptions about their behavior. Despite being loving and loyal companions, they are frequently labeled as "aggressive" based on breed stereotypes. Many shelters still euthanize pit bulls who display signs of stress or fear, even though aggression is not inherently linked to breed. This practice overlooks the importance of training, socialization, and environment in shaping a dogâ€™s behavior. As a result, many adoptable pit bulls are euthanized, perpetuating stigma and limiting their chances for a loving home. It's crucial to judge dogs as individuals, not by breed.</p>
