            <h2>What is a No-Kill Shelter?</h2>
            <p>A "no-kill" shelter is an animal rescue that saves every healthy, adoptable pet and only euthanizes animals for severe medical or behavioral reasons. These shelters focus on finding homes for pets, providing necessary medical care, and offering adoption services. They often rely on foster care and community partnerships to avoid overcrowding. While the term "no-kill" can vary, the goal is to eliminate unnecessary euthanasia, giving every animal a chance at a better life. No-kill shelters work to reduce pet overpopulation and promote responsible pet ownership through education and outreach.</p>
